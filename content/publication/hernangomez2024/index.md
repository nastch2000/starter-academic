abstract: This article presents two wireless measurement campaigns in industrial testbeds: industrial vehicle-to-vehicle (iV2V) and industrial vehicle-to-in-frastructure plus sensor (iV21+), with detailed information about the two captured datasets. iV2V covers sidelink communication scenarios between moving and stationary robots, while iV21+ is conducted at an industrial setting where an autonomous cleaning robot is connected to a private cellular network. 

# The combination of different communication technologies within a common measurement methodology provides insights that can be exploited by ML for tasks, such as fingerprinting, line-of-sight detection, prediction of quality of service, or link selection. Moreover, the datasets are publicly available, labeled, and pre-filtered for fast on-boarding and applicability.
