abstract: Abstract—During the last few years, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) wireless communication has become a key objective for enabling
future cooperative safety applications, such as intersection collision warning. In this paper, we present the results of a 5.9 GHz
V2V performance measurement campaign at four different urban
intersections under NLOS conditions using commercial off-theshelf wireless interface cards which meet the 802.11p and ITSG5 specifications.
