abstract: Through the wireless exchange of information between vehicles and their neighborhood, Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) open up a wide range of road safety, traffic efficiency and infotainment applications. However, due to the single-hop broadcast of status information on a single channel, the performance of VANETs will directly depend on the severity of the inevitable channel interference. In this paper, we investigate the impact of co-channel interference on the performance of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication based on 5.9 GHz real world measurements conducted at intersections under line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions. To particularly analyze the impact of static radio shadowing on interference severity, we perform a set of scenarios at two different intersections. Moreover, we introduce an abstraction approach based on a configuration of a single vehicle as a set of vehicles in order to diminish the logistic issue as well as the complexity caused by the synchronization of measurement runs.
