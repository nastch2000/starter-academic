abstract: One of the key challenges of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication is to ensure a reliable information exchange in such a way that a cooperative awareness between vehicles is permanently established, regardless of the considered environment and
traffic conditions. Consequently, V2V applications have to fulfill quality requirements in order to help drivers in critical situations on rural and motorway roads,
as well as in urban and inner-city areas. However, due to the presence of radio
shadowing, a significant portion of message transmissions will be susceptible to
recurrent signal attenuation caused by buildings or vegetation. For this purpose,
it is essential to perform a deep analysis of the fundamental wave propagation
characteristics in typical vehicular environments. The first part of this thesis covers
a measurement-based evaluation of V2V communication by focusing on stationary radio shadowing at urban intersections. Hereby, we examine, based on several measurement campaigns, the impact of building and vegetation obstructions
on the communication quality. In urban agglomerations, the communication performance is directly associated to availability of a constant line of sight between
vehicles, which may depend on the distribution of buildings. Therefore, we provided an in-depth analysis and characterization of urban intersections based on
digital maps from selected European big cities. It has been found that intersections
with three up to four corners occupied by buildings are the most frequent. In addition, while the related work did not sufficiently address the scalability problem
of Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) experimentally, we present an abstraction
method to overcome logistic issues during real-world measurements. More particularly, we evaluate the impact of buildings on the severity of co-channel interference
through experiments carried out at two different intersections.
The second part of this thesis addresses the performance evaluation of V2V communication at urban intersections by analyzing the influence of building shadowing and penetration rates. Since the evaluation is performed by means of simulation, we propose a hybrid simulation platform composed of a network simulator and a road traffic simulator. To ensure applicability of simulation results, an
ITS-G5 conform protocol stack from the application layer up to the physical layer
is scrupulously modeled under the simulation tool OMNeT++. As propagation
models may directly affect the level of accuracy in simulation-based performance
evaluations, we introduce a dedicated urban propagation model designed to reflect radio propagation on urban environments in a realistic way. After a careful
selection of representative scenarios, we perform a simulation campaign under
variation of environment factors and communication parameters. We particularly
concentrate on the scalability issue and the influence of intersection type on the
communication performance. The obtained results indicate that performance of
V2V communication at urban intersection is directly linked to the type of the intersection, and packet collisions are mainly caused by the channel access mechanism
due to the broadcast nature of V2V communication.
