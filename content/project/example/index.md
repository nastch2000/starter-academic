Many applications in the fi eld of cooperative autonomous driving or mobile
robotics   due   to   the   highly   dynamic   nature   of   their   environment   will
necessitate the deployment of ultra-reliable wireless links that can provide
real-time, low-latency control for such autonomous systems. An important
challenge is therefore to guarantee the end-to-end quality of service (QoS)
required by the respective application. Integrating fundamental notions of
artifi cial intelligence (AI) across the wireless infrastructure and end-user
devices has gained a tremendous interest not only in the improvement of
road safety but also in the industry4.0 domain by reducing quality control
eff orts   and   operational costs  on  exponential  levels.   One   major   gain  of
exploiting AI to optimize the operation of wireless-based use cases is the
prediction   of   future   network   performance   indicators   also   known   as
predictive Quality of Service (pQoS). Intelligent AI-based PQoS methods
must   be   able   to   adaptively   exploit   the   wireless   system   resources   and
generated data, in order to optimize network operation and guarantee, in
real-time, the QoS needs of highly mobile use cases.
